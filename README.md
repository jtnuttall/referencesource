**NOTE: This repository is no longer used to track Mono patches to referencesource after https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/2962, the code now lives in the Mono repository.**

# .NET Reference Source

The referencesource repository contains sources from [Microsoft .NET Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/)
that represent a subset of the .NET Framework.  This subset contains similar functionality to the class libraries that are being
developed in [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx).  We intend to consult the referencesource repository as we develop
.NET Core.  It is also for the community to leverage to enable more scenarios for .NET developers. 

**Please note that the referencesource repository is read-only**. [See this blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx) for the rationale.

Questions, bugs, and pull requests should be done through [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx).
